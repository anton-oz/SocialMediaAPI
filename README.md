# Social Media API

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

I built this project to strengthen my knowledge of building API endpoints that use Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database.

## Installation

To install this project you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager). You will also need to [install MongoDB](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb). Once you have both installed navigate to the root directory in the CLI and enter `npm i` to install dependencies. To interact with the api you will also need a API tester since this project has no front-end (I use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)). You are now fully installed!

## Usage

To start up the app first seed the database with `npm run seed`. Once the database is seeded enter `npm run start` or `npm run dev` to start the app. To interact with the API use the routes defined in [`routes/api`](./routes/api/) on your API tester of choice and interact with the data!
